# Constrained and Vanishing Expressivity of Quantum Fourier Models 
This code reproduces the figures in [Constrained and Vanishing Expressivity of Quantum Fourier Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09417). It implements the process of calculating empirical, analytic values and upper bounds of Fourier Coefficients for the Data Reuploading Model. 

## Tutorial
An example on how to run the functions is available in the [`main.ipynb`](/main.ipynb) notebook.
